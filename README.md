# Project that I am working on at Institute

This is where most of my projects are stored, but many of them have been lost. Here are some `Java` projects. I have also done `Web` projects.

## About the School

I studied at the [Bray Institute of Further Education  (BIFE)](https://bife.ie). The Institute is located in Bray, Ireland. This is [`Computer Software Development`](https://www.bife.ie/full-time-courses/computing-and-engineering/computer-software-development) course ([Link from web.archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231109155715/https://www.bife.ie/full-time-courses/computing-and-engineering/computer-software-development) because the original link is not working). I studied there from 2022 to 2023 (1 year).
